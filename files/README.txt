|================  GOAL  =============================================================================================|
|---> Collect the food to increase your score, while avoiding crashing onto the poisonous bait.						  |
|																													  |
|																													  |
|================  CONTROLS  =========================================================================================|
|---> Use the ARROW KEYS to move the ball to the respective direction.												  |
|																													  |
|---> Press P to pause, press it again to resume, and so on.														  |
|																													  |
|---> Press SPACE to stop the ball, if you feel it's gotten out of control.											  |
|			Then, just use the ARROW KEYS to get it moving again.													  |
|																													  |
|																													  |
|================  THINGS TO NOTE  ===================================================================================|
|---> You can press a particular ARROW KEY more than once, thus accelerating the ball to the corresponding direction. |
|																													  |
|---> Holding keys down has a cumulative effect,																	  |
			you don't need to release and (re)press to register an (extra) keystroke.	  							  |
|																													  |
|---> Applying forces to both axes is supported, resulting in compound velocity										  |
|			(i.e. the ball can move at any anlge).														  			  |
|																													  |
|---> There is a chance that when a new food item is spawned, a poisoned one is spawned with it.					  |
|			Collect the food item to destroy the poison that came with it.								  			  |
|																													  |
|---> The larger the food item, the higher the score boost.															  |
|																													  |
|---> The faster the ball moves, the hotter it becomes.																  |
|			This serves as a visual indicator of its speed, as it glows.								  			  |
|																													  |
|---> To register a collision, the *center point* of the ball must be located inside the food/poison square.		  |
